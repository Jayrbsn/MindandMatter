            <h1>Chivaughn Naidoo-Robson</h1>
            <p>Chivaughn has had a passion for psychology and mental health for as long as she can remember, even being able to diagnose characters’ personality disorders and mental illnesses on TV and in movies that she used to watch as a student. Though as a counsellor she is not permitted to make patient diagnosis, she is still readily able to identify the issues suffered by clients is matched perfectly by her wealth of knowledge in the best courses to take to solve any mental health problem.
               <br><br>After spending some time working and travelling in her youth, collecting valuable life experience, and developing a deep understanding of people along the way, she enrolled to complete her Bachelor of Science at Wits University, where she majored in psychology. From there she did her honours degree at the gruelling South African College of Applied Psychology.<br><br> It was during this qualification that she began volunteering her skills during her spare time to the South African Depression and Anxiety Group (SADAG). Although initially this was mainly intended to pad her CV before completing her master’s degree in clinical psychology, it quickly became clear that the counselling side of psychology was where she fit best. Having found her niche, she quickly climbed the ranks to become a senior counsellor at SADAG, where she still mans the night shift telephonic counselling lines for universities and NPOs.
               <br><br>As an avid studier of people, Chivaughn loves to watch TV and movies in her spare time. She also loves to go to the gym with her husband and plans to continue satisfying her wanderlust well into old age.
